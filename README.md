# MA

This repository contains everything for my MA thesis. That is, the literature cited in the MA thesis, the data of the experiments, the documentation of the experiments, notes (e. g. sketches, to do lists), the versions of the thesis paper, and information about the formalities, submission, and grading of the thesis.
